This will be a quick guide for how to get "Go to Definition" working in typescript monorepos instead of the `*.d.ts` files created by the build step. Colin McDonnell wrote [a great walkthrough](https://colinhacks.com/essays/live-types-typescript-monorepo) of the different approaches to solving this problem, along with all of the tradeoffs. For this post, we'll just talk about how to use the recommended solution: "customConditions".

## Configuring exports in package.json

First, you'll want to specify the typescript file that acts as the entrypoint for each of your exports.

```json
"exports": {
  "./package.json": "./package.json",
  ".": {
    "my-internal": "./src/main.ts",
    "types": "./dist/main.d.ts",
    "default": "./dist/main.js"
  },
},
```

In this case, I have chosen the custom condition of `my-internal`, but this could be almost anything (stay away from import, require, types, default, etc.).

If you have other exports, add the ts file to those too. It's important that the `my-internal` condition is the first one listed, otherwise it will not be used.

```json
"exports": {
  "./package.json": "./package.json",
  ".": {
    "my-internal": "./src/main.ts",
    "types": "./dist/main.d.ts",
    "default": "./dist/main.js"
  },
  "./other": {
    "my-internal": "./src/other.ts",
    "types": "./dist/other.d.ts",
    "default": "./dist/other.js"
  }
},
```

## Configuring the tsconfig.json

Use the custom condition in all of your monorepos tsconfig's. In this case, it is helpful if all your tsconfigs extend a single base config.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "customConditions": ["my-internal"]
  }
}
```

## In case you use vite

In your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
export default {
  resolve: {
    conditions: ["my-internal"],
  },
  // this part is for vite 6 support
  environments: {
    ssr: {
      resolve: {
        conditions: ["my-internal"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## A simple example and farewell

Here is an example PR where we moved the tanstack/query monorepo from the tsconfig paths technique, over to the customCondition approach: [tanstack/query#9042](https://github.com/TanStack/query/pull/9042)

Hopefully you find this helpful and hopefully more monorepos support working "go to definition"!
